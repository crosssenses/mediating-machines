  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

      description: >-
        The team analyzes the practical needs and potential strategic purposes
        of AI in mediation support, as well as the organizational and
        technological ecosystems in which AI tools would be embedded.

      title: Data and Methods
      description: >-
        The team explores  which methodological and data requirements AI-driven
        analytical tools will have to fulfill to serve mediators needs. In
        particular, we explore options for  transparent AI and related questions
        of inference methods.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
