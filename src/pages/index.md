      title: Mediator's Needs and Ecosystems
      description: >-
        The team will analyze the practical needs and potential strategic
        purposes of AI in mediation support, as well as the organizational and
        technological ecosystems in which AI tools could be embedded. We will
        examine existing efforts to create AI applications for mediators and
        explore how argument data could be used by mediators to assess dynamics
        of negotiation.

        title: Designing Digital Inclusion in Peacemaking
        text: >-
          Arguments can be collected and analyzed as part of inclusive
          peacemaking efforts. Digital technologies play a key role in
          facilitating such processes. The most important insights from the
          "Designing Digital Inclusion" Project, conducted at the Graduate
          Institute of International Development Studies. The full text is

          International Conflict Resolution
        text: >-
          Artificial Intelligence plays an increasing role in Cybermediation and
          Digital Peacemaking. This report by the DiploFoundation provides an
          overview of the current debate on the use of Artificial Intelligence
          in Peace Mediation. The full text is available

    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  heading: About the project
  description: >-
    In today’s technologized world, efforts to end armed conflict through
    mediation are increasingly shaped by digital technologies. While peacemaking
    traditionally has been considered a human-centered activity, negotiations
    are often supplemented with online activities. Social media has come to
    change the landscape of conflict, with conflict parties and stakeholders
    pro-actively using different online platforms to make their voices heard.
    The digitization of peace processes produces large amounts of data, which
    cannot be sufficiently analyzed using conventional means.


    Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers opportunities to develop tools that
    could support mediators and their teams in gathering and analyzing the data
    produced in the context of peace processes. Although the topic of AI has
    come to receive increased attention in the field of peace mediation, there
    is a lack of concrete examples and applications that could bring discussions
    forward. This project will therefore explore the ways in which
    AI-applications could be used in peacemaking, while raising important
    questions about potential challenges these applications might pose.


    In particular, the research will analyze how AI can support the analysis of
    arguments and opinions voiced by conflict parties and stakeholders in
    digital data. To this end, the project builds on recent advances in
    text-mining of online participation processes.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
