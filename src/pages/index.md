  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

        The team analyzes the practical needs and potential strategic purposes
        of AI in mediation support, as well as the organizational and

        The team explores  which methodological and data requirements AI-driven
        analytical tools will have to fulfill to serve mediators needs. In
        particular, we explore options for  transparent AI and related questions
        of inference methods.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...
title: Mediating machines
about:
  heading: About the project
  description: >-
    In today’s  technologized world, efforts to end armed conflict through
    mediation are increasingly shaped by digital technologies. While peacemaking
    traditionally has been considered a human-centered activity, negotiations
    are often supplemented with online activities. Social media has come to
    change the landscape of conflict, with conflict parties and stakeholders
    pro-actively using different online platforms to make their voices heard.
    The digitization of peace processes produces large amounts of data, which
    cannot be sufficiently analyzed using conventional means.


    Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers opportunities to develop tools that
    could support mediators and their teams in gathering and analyzing the data
    produced in the context of peace processes. Although the topic of AI has
    come to receive increased attention in the field of peace mediation, there
    is a lack of concrete examples and applications that could bring discussions
    forward. This project will therefore explore the ways in which
    AI-applications could be used in peacemaking, while raising important
    questions about potential challenges these applications might pose.


    In particular, the research will analyze how AI can support the analysis of
    arguments and opinions voiced by conflict parties and stakeholders in
    digital data. To this end, the project builds on recent advances in
    text-mining of online participation processes.

    Graduate Institute of International Development Studies, Geneva (IHEID), the
    FraunhoferInstitute of Optronics, System Technologies and Image
    Exploitation(IOSB), Universität Düsseldorf and SwissPeace.

        The team will analyze the practical needs and potential strategic
        purposes of AI in mediation support, as well as the organizational and
        technological ecosystems in which AI tools could be embedded. We will
        examine existing efforts to create AI applications for mediators and
        explore how argument data could be used by mediators to assess dynamics
        of negotiation.

        The team will discuss  the methodological and data requirements of
        AI-supported argument analysis. We will look at options for transparent
        and explainable  AI and related questions of inference methods. The team
        will also identify and analyze various data sources for
        machine-supported argument analysis, including data derived from social
        media and other digital inclusion efforts.

        The team will identify data visualization techniques that can help 
        integrate AI outputs into  mediator’s workflows and decision-making
        processes. This includes  geographic visualization and graph-based
        techniques  graph-based techniques. We will also explore the prospects
        of creating visual data mining tools that present multiple perspectives
        on the data through several visualization styles and interactive data
        analysis.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
